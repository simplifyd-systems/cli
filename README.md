The Simplifyd terminal application

## Installation

### MacOS and Linux
Run the following command in your terminal to install the Simplifyd CLI application:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplifyd-systems/cli/master/install.sh | sh
```

You can view what actions the script takes [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplifyd-systems/cli/master/install.sh).

### Windows
- Download the Edge CLI executable file [here](https://github.com/simplifyd-systems/cli/releases). Make sure to choose the version that applies to your system architecture.
- Extract the zip archive.
- Copy the executable file `edge.exe` preferably to a folder in your system's $PATH variable. This ensures you can simply run `edge.exe` in terminal from any directory. If you don't copy the executable to a folder or directory that's in your system's $PATH variable, then remember to always use the full path to the executable whenever you run it, for example: `c:\path\to\cli\edge.exe`. 

## Verifying your installation
To verify your CLI installation, use the `edge --version` command:

## Getting started
After you install the CLI, run the `edge` command.

If you do not already have an account you can signup for one. Run the command `edge` and select the `Sign up` option to do so.
